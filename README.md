# ðŸ“¦ Amazon Product Review Analysis
This project was developed as a part of Digital Skill Up (DSA) Data analysis Capstone, focused on helping Amazon sellers understand the trends in products pricing, discounts, ratings, price buckets and potential revenue. Using a dataset of 1,466 Amazon product listings, the goal was to generate business insights using Google sheets.
## ðŸ“š Project Background
Amazon's marketplace contains thousands of products, and sellers rely on pricing strategies, reviews and discount campaigns to drive customer engagement and products improvements. Without analysis , it is difficult to identify which product categories are performing well, which discounted producted attract more customers and how discounts affect customer's satisfaction.
As a Junior Data analyst at **RetailTech Insights**, my task was to analyse product listings and present key metrics through a dashboard to inform startegic business decisions 
## ðŸŽ¯ Business Objectives
- What is the average discount percentage by product category? 
- How many products are listed under each category? 
- What is the total number of reviews per category?

- What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category? 
- Which products have the highest number of reviews? 
- How many products have a discount of 50% or more? 
- What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 
4.0, etc.)? 
- What is the total potential revenue (actual_price Ã— rating_count) by category? 
- What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <â‚¹200, 
â‚¹200â€“â‚¹500, >â‚¹500)? 
- How does the rating relate to the level of discount? 
- How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
