# ðŸ“¦ Amazon Product Review Analysis
This project was developed as a part of Digital Skill Up (DSA) Data analysis Capstone, focused on helping Amazon sellers understand the trends in products pricing, discounts, ratings, price buckets and potential revenue. Using a dataset of 1,466 Amazon product listings, the goal was to generate business insights using Google sheets.
## ðŸ“š Project Background
Amazon's marketplace contains thousands of products, and sellers rely on pricing strategies, reviews and discount campaigns to drive customer engagement and products improvements. Without analysis , it is difficult to identify which product categories are performing well, which discounted producted attract more customers and how discounts affect customer's satisfaction.
